## Wtf?
This project uses device-tree overlays to enable specific hardware devices on the Beaglebone-Black platform.
Furthermore I tried to make some effort to automate the build and install steps of device tree overlays.
This can be seen by the Makefile hierarchy within the project. The top-level Makefile has targets as simple to
use as a light switch. The magic happens in the deeper levels of the source tree.

## Overlays

### I2C

#### Real time clock (RTC)


### SPI


## Scripts
